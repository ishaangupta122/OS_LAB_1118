// Write  a  C  program  using  semaphores  to  solve  the  Producer-Consumer  Problem, where:
// • The Producer thread generates data items and places them into a bounded buffer.
// • The Consumer thread removes items from the buffer and processes them.
// Use semaphores to ensure mutual exclusion and proper synchronization between threads.
